# TV Prototyping Tool

This code base is a work in progress and I am by no means a seasoned developer. Please feel free to collaborate and fix anything you feel can be improved or changed.

**Setup**
1) Download the code repo and add to your local or cloud server. 
2) Create a free account at AirTable. This will be the cloud Database. I am exploring other options but was looking for a simple approach to recording basic data without creating a MYSQL database. 
3) Update your AirTable details in the admin-functions.js file. You will need your $apiKeyValue, $apiBaseValue and Table Name. You can easily get this once you have created a table and viewed the API.
4) Files are uploaded to your local server.

Your all set.
